# Tab Switching Issue - Solution Summary

## Problem Fixed âœ…

The issue where leaving a tab with Nestie and returning would cause:
- Automatic redirects to dashboard regardless of current page
- Loss of form input data (search queries, filters, etc.)
- Interruption of user workflows
- Reset of component state

## Root Cause Identified

The problem was in the `onAuthStateChange` listener in `app/page.tsx` that was automatically redirecting users to their dashboard whenever the auth state changed, which happens when tabs regain focus due to token refresh events.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Session State Management System (`lib/sessionStateManager.ts`)
- **Tab Activity Tracking**: Monitors when tabs become active/inactive using `visibilitychange` and `focus`/`blur` events
- **Redirect Prevention**: Blocks automatic redirects for 2 seconds after tab becomes active
- **State Persistence**: Automatically saves form data, scroll position, and component state to sessionStorage
- **Smart Restoration**: Restores saved state when returning to the tab

### 2. Enhanced Components

**Updated Files:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Added tab state awareness to prevent unwanted redirects
- `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Respects tab state when checking authentication
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Preserves search queries and filters
- `app/agent/dashboard/page.tsx` - Maintains dashboard state and form inputs

**Key Features Added:**
- Form inputs now have proper `name` attributes for state preservation
- Automatic state saving when tab becomes inactive
- State restoration when tab becomes active
- Debug indicator for development mode

### 3. Smart Redirect Logic

```typescript
// Before: Always redirected on auth state change
const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
  async (_, session) => {
    if (session?.user) {
      router.push('/dashboard') // This caused the issue
    }
  }
)

// After: Only redirects when appropriate
const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
  async (event, session) => {
    if (session?.user) {
      // Only redirect on actual auth events, not tab focus
      if (!shouldPreventRedirect && event !== 'TOKEN_REFRESHED') {
        router.push('/dashboard')
      }
    }
  }
)
```

## How It Works

1. **Tab Becomes Inactive**: 
   - System automatically saves current form data and component state
   - Preserves scroll position and active tab selections

2. **Tab Becomes Active**:
   - Redirect protection activates for 2 seconds
   - Saved state is automatically restored
   - Form inputs are repopulated with previous values

3. **State Persistence**:
   - Uses sessionStorage for cross-tab-switch persistence
   - Debounced saving prevents performance issues
   - Automatic cleanup of old state data

## Testing the Fix

To verify the solution works:

1. **Fill out search form** in dashboard
2. **Switch to another tab** (e.g., open a new website)
3. **Return to Nestie tab**
4. **Verify**:
   - âœ… No unwanted redirect occurred
   - âœ… Search query is still there
   - âœ… Filters are preserved
   - âœ… Scroll position maintained
   - âœ… Component state intact

## Development Mode Debug

In development mode, you'll see a small indicator in the top-right corner showing:
- Tab status (Active/Inactive)
- Protection status when redirects are blocked

## Files Modified

- `lib/sessionStateManager.ts` - New session state management system
- `lib/formStateManager.ts` - Form state preservation utilities  
- `lib/tabStateManager.ts` - Basic tab state tracking (legacy)
- `components/TabStateIndicator.tsx` - Debug indicator component
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated with tab state awareness
- `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Added redirect prevention
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added state preservation
- `app/agent/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added state preservation
- `docs/TAB_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Users can switch tabs without losing their work
2. **Preserved Context**: Return to exactly where they left off
3. **No More Frustration**: Eliminated unexpected redirects
4. **Better Workflow**: Support for multi-tab usage patterns
5. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient state management with minimal overhead

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extensible. Future improvements could include:
- Cross-browser tab synchronization
- Advanced form validation state preservation
- Integration with browser history API
- Offline state management
